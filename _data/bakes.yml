  name: "Chocolate orange shortbread biscuits"
  description: "These were so simple to make and came out absolutely melt-in-the-mouth delicious! I adore chocolate orange so these have already cemented themselves as one of my favourite bakes ever. I decided to pipe on the orange chocolate instead of dipping them since I didn't have long for them to set and also some of the chocolate orange went missing mysteriously. The piping was a little messy, so I'd like to improve that when I try them again."

  name: "Plaited bread centerpiece"
  description: "This was a practice loaf to be used as a centrepiece. The idea is to put a bowl full of delicious dip or a baked camembert in the centre. It came out ok for the first time I've made bread in years. The plait could have been neater, but that's something to improve for next time."

  description: "It's almost that time of year again, so I thought I'd make some vaguely seasonal cookies (the cranberries are what make them Christmas-y). I made a double batch of approx. 55 and they all came out pretty much perfect."

  name: "Blueberry and lemon mini muffins"
  description: "I made these for a co-worker's Birthday. They were a litte dry considering they had yoghurt in them (which usually makes for a moister bake). Next time I'd try them full size as I think them being so small and me cooking them for slightly too long was what let them down."

  description: "These were made to celebrate 5 years together with the fella. I took them in to work a little disappointed that they hadn't come out that well - I was shocked by how much everyone loved them. I'd definitely give these another whirl."

  description: "Another batch of these Marshmellow Cupcakes. When making them there's sometimes leftover melted marshmellow left in my makeshift piping bag and I love to pipe it directly in to my mouth! Such a piggy!"

  name: "Ombre Wedding cake, v2.0"
  description: "My sister is getting married in June 2015 and wanted a 'cutting cake' (she's buying in cupcakes, but wanted something to cut). She doesn't like traditional wedding cakes so I'm making her an ombre vanilla/toffee/chocolate cake with ganache filling white chocolate decorations. This is version 2.0 and it went very well - my sister got to try it and she absolutely loved it, so I was chuffed to bits. Now I just have to keep practising it to get it spot on!"

  name: "Drupal cupcakes"
  description: "I made these to take to the North West Drupal User Group for Drupal's 13th Birthday. These were basic Hummingbird Bakery vanilla cupcakes with blue food-die in a vanilla icing. I then created a custom mold from a sheet of kitchen-grade silicon into which I poured melted chocolate. Once set, I made a stencil for the Drupal logo features and then used edible gold spray to complete the chocolate decoration. They went down really well! The only thing I would have done better is the icing piping - I just used a hole cut in the edge of a sandwich bag."

  name: "Marshmellow cupcakes"
  description: "A few of my colleagues at work absolutely love these cupcakes. I enjoy eating them, but they are such a faff to make! This batch came out great! The frosting is nice and easy with these cupcakes because you don't need to worry about piping it nicely - just mix it with mini marshmellows and stodge it on top!"
